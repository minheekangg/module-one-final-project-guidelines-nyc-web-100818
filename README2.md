## Let's play Sitcom Trivia!

Test your knowledge on all-time favorite sitcoms - The Office, Parks and Rec, Seinfeld, Friends, The IT Crowd, and How I Met Your Mother!


This game will throw a random quote from 1 of 6 sitcoms above and the player will have to choose the correct name of the sitcom. If the player chooses the correct answer, they will move on to the next question. If the player fails to choose the correct answer, the player will be shown their score for the game (total score + number of quotes recognized from each sitcom) and the player will be prompt to play again or quit the game.

If the player does well and make it into top 10 high scores, the player's name will be shown after exiting the game, along with the hardest question.
